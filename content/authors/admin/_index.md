Hi everyone, welcome to visit my web!
I am a Ph.D. graduate student at the University of California, SanDiego in Computer Science and Engineering Department. I started my research journey to explore next generation memory system & storage system in 2023 fall. I fortunately have been working with Prof. Tajana Rosing. If you have any questions or needs, please reach out to me!
